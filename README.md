# SimpleTrafficLightClassification

The most simple traffic light classification CNN machine learning model.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying traffic lights into three categories:
- **Go** (Green light)
- **Stop** (Red light)
- **Slow** (Yellow light)

The model is lightweight and designed for straightforward implementation, suitable for beginners and those exploring computer vision concepts in machine learning.

## Features
- **Easy to understand:** Designed with simplicity in mind to make it accessible for learners.
- **Fast training:** Optimized for quick experimentation and iteration.
- **Basic preprocessing:** Includes fundamental steps to prepare data for training.

## Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to create a simple yet functional machine learning model for recognizing traffic lights. This prototype can serve as a starting point for more complex systems, such as those assisting the visually impaired or autonomous vehicles.
 
## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset                                                                                                                 
           
2. Train the model 
 
3. Test the model
 
4. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy or F1-score.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
- Fully connected layers for classification.

The architecture has been kept simple for educational purposes.
